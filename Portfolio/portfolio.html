            Growing up outside of Philadelphia I was always interested in music. After experimenting with multiple instruments
            I eventually settled on the drumset. I began to write music and play in local bands before being accepted to
            Berklee College of Music, in Boston, and majoring in their Music Business program.

            After graduating from Berklee I moved to New York to land a job on the business side of the music industry, working with
            performing rights organizations, radio, and record labels. During this time I have continued to remain interested
            in my creative side by writing music with local bands. Web development is a natural expansion of my creative
            and business experience for the next stage in my life. I currently reside in Jersey City with my wife and dog.
